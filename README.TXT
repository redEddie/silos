	The program has specific limitations to prevent usage for commercial
	purposes.  There are features and capabilities which are intentionally 
	reduced or disabled.

	The demonstration version is limited to 200 gates and 350 lines of 
	behavioral code.

2)  	The Silos 2001 User's Manual is now available in PDF format
	in the "doc" subdirectory of the Silos 2001 CD and the Simucad

Silos 2001 is a graphical framework that integrates tools for the Verilog HDL designer.
The tools featured in the framework are:

	- Code Coverage;
	- Finite State Machine Editor;
	- Chromacoded Editor;
	- Help System;
	- Silos Simulator;
	- Hierarchy Browser;
	- Waveform Viewer.


This demonstration version of Silos 2001 supports features from the IEEE 1364-2001
Verilog Hardware Description Language Standard. This demonstration version of Silos 2001 
also supports the Programming Language Interface (PLI), and the Standard Delay File (SDF) 
format.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 
-------------------------

1) 	At least 16 MB of available memory is recommended.  Memory usage 
	varies depending on the design.  

2)	The installation requires less than 50 Mb of disk space.  
	The amount of disk needed during simulation will vary based 
	on the size of the circuit and its activity. 

3)      Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows ME, Windows NT (version 4.0 or higher).



INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------

1)	Start your PC and get into Windows. 
	(you already did this step)

2)	Insert CD-ROM provided into the CD-ROM drive (D:) 
	and open file "D:\README.TXT" to read the installation 
	instructions. (You have completed this step also).

3)	Double-click on "D:\SETUP.EXE"

5)	Answer the questions when prompted by the 
	SILOS 2001 installation program. This will install
        SILOS 2001 software. See the README.TXT file in the
        SILOS 2001 installation directory for instructions on
        running the simulator.

6)	Copy "D:\VERILOG_BOOK_EXAMPLES" directory to a desired location
        on your computer's hard drive (C:). This directory contains Verilog
        source for examples from the book. Remember to make this
        directory writable.

7)	You are now ready to run the simulator with the book examples.
        To run an example from the Verilog book, simply go into
        the "VERILOG_BOOK_EXAMPLES" directory on your hard drive (C:) and 
        follow the instructions in the README.TXT file.
